# Website Link Checker
 My website/project was made to help those who use the internet a alot and who may also come across suspicious links. As a person who is interested in cybersecurity and data privacy, staying safe online has always been a topic I have been interested in. This website uses Google's Safe Browsing API that contains data regarding websites flagged as dangerous by Google while simultaneously levergaging a Supabase database to house user-submitted data. I hope this website will help future users stay safe while using the internet. 

This project was developed using Google Chrome on Windows 11 OS, and is designed to operate on the stated platforms.
