# Website Link Checker
<p>
 My website/project was made to help those who use the internet a alot and who may also come across suspicious links. As a person who is interested in cybersecurity and data privacy, staying safe online has always been a topic I have been interested in. This website uses Google's Safe Browsing API that contains data regarding websites flagged as dangerous by Google while simultaneously levergaging a Supabase database to house user-submitted data. I hope this website will help future users stay safe while using the internet. 

This project was developed using Google Chrome on Windows 11 OS, and is designed to operate on the stated platforms. Mac compatability may be a future venture when funds are secured for a system that can run Mac OS.

# Developer Manual
## Applications and Dependencies
### Node.js
<p> Node.js helps web developers create a remote environment to run their applications, similar to the "Go Live" feature in VS Code. 
 
To download Node.js go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and use the installer for the appropriate OS. </p>

### Nodemon
<p> Node.js is required for Nodemon, hence it being downloaded first. Nodemon is an application that automatically restarts the server page when edits are being made from the IDE, removing the need to mangually refresh the live page every time an edit is made. 

Once Node.js is installed, open Windows terminal using `Windows + r` and then typing `cmd`. Once in the terminal, type `npm install -g nodemon` to install Nodemon. Once installed, type `nodemon "your app/file"</p>
